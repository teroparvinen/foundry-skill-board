# Skill Board for the Foundry VTT

For the DND5E system.

Adds a hotkeyable (default K) panel that shows a character's skills. This module is intended to be used in conjunction with
[Action Pack](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/action-pack) or similar modules that help keep the character sheet out of the way
most of the time.

You can also add multiple characters to the sheet for the cases where you have a player controlling multiple PCs or possibly
have a player control NPCs, like sidekicks, familiars or similar.

## Features

- Open the panel with the scene control button or a hotkey
- Click any skill modifier on the sheet to make a skill roll. Supports all the standard modifiers
    - Alt to roll with advantage
    - Ctrl/Cmd to roll with disadvantage
    - Shift to fast-forward roll, i.e. roll immediately with default options skipping the dialog
- The immediate roll can also be done using the right mouse button
- The sheet shows the user's main character by default
    - Additional characters can be added or removed using the context menu options in the actor list
- Click on the token to open the character sheet
- Two visual variants: Standard sheet and pop out. Selectable from the settings
